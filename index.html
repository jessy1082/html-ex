    <p class=para>Geckos <em> are a </em> group of usually small, usually nocturnal lizards. They are found on every
        continent except Australia.</p>

    <p class=para>Some species live in houses where they hunt insects attracted by artificial light.</p>
    <p>Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest
        for readers to scan, but they can also be separated
        by indenting their first lines. This is often used
        to take up less space, such as to save paper in print.</p>

    <p>Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school
        papers and rough drafts, uses both blank lines and
        indentation for separation. In finished works, combining
        both is considered redundant and amateurish.</p>

    <p>In very old writing, paragraphs were separated with a
        special character: Â¶, the <i>pilcrow</i>. Nowadays, this
        is considered claustrophobic and hard to read.</p>

    <p>How hard to read? See for yourself:
